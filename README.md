# Image to Ascii
## Description
This program allows you to turn any old image into a modern, cutting-edge piece of original ASCII art! All you have to do is run

    python3 itoa.py <path-to-image>
  
and it will write to a file called ``text.txt``. 

## Options
The program automatically will choose an optimal aspect ratio for you, but if you'd like to specify your own, be my guest! Just run 

    python3 itoa.py <path-to-image> <width> <height>
  

Have fun!
